# SHA 256 using CryptoCell

This is an example of sha256 hashing performed on Nordic devices that shows how to compute and verify hashes in a secure environment using cryptocell.

## The sample performs the following operations:

- Initialization of the Platform Security Architecture (PSA) API.
- Calculation and verification of a SHA-256 hash on a sample plaintext.
- Using mult-part SHA256.

## Testing

After programming the sample to your development kit, complete the following steps to test it:

1. Connect terminal.
2. Compile and program the application.
3. Observe the logs from the application using a terminal emulator.
